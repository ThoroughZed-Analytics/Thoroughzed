## Git Process

- All components will be tracked and live on GH
- The team is all in the same org which hosts the repo
- Git Flow
  - Main (production) branch: We only push to this when the project is basically complete. Two approvals required.
  - Development branch: Pushes to this branch must be approved by one other team member.
- We'll merge branches on at least a bi-daily basis
- We'll communicate over slack or remo.
